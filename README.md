# AC Mods
This Repository covers multiple mods I made for Assault Cube and serves as archive!

## End
I made these mods way back when I got into cheating but I'm definitely done with Assault Cube. I was planning to finish the Tipley Mod Menu but for reasons I will not disclose, I have less time and it generall is unnecessary. All this should still work with the correct versions though.

This mod menu grants you access to various gamechanging features!

Features will be enabled/disabled by (un)ticking boxes.

## Instructions

1. Install Assault Cube ([official page](https://assault.cubers.net/download.html))
2. Install [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) (direct download link: [Cheat Engine](https://d1vdn3r1396bak.cloudfront.net/installer/42511337/21191504383817), for more info click [HERE](#cenotice))
3. Install this [Repository](https://github.com/DraxFM/AC-Health-Cheats/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

## Setup
1. Install the [Repository](https://github.com/DraxFM/AC-Health-Cheats/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and extract it to your desired path.
2. Open the extracted folder and open the "**TipleyModMenu**" folder.
3. In there, you should find a **ac_client.ct** file.
4. Launch Cheat Engine and drag the **ac_client.ct** file into the bottom bar.
5. On the top left corner of the cheat engine window should be a glowing computer. Click it, press on the "**AssaultCube**" process in the window (make sure you have AssaultCube running, else Cheat Engine can't find the process!!!) that should pop up and press open.
6. The Tipley Mod Menu is now set up!

### <a id="cenotice"></a>Cheat Engine Notice
The [official page](https://www.cheatengine.org/) of Cheat Engine looks pretty fishy. To this day nobody knows why exactly but cheat engine is proved not to be malicious so don't get afraid of the downloading page.
